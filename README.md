# FPC365 — Fluent Persian Converter 365

A Chrome/Edge (Manifest V3) extension that converts Gregorian dates on Microsoft
platforms — Dynamics 365, SharePoint, OneDrive, Office, Outlook, Teams — into the
Persian (Jalali) calendar, and provides a (mock) UI translation layer.

This repository is a full TypeScript rewrite of the original JavaScript extension,
organized as an **onion / clean architecture** so that domain logic stays free of
browser and DOM concerns.

---

## Architecture

Dependencies point **inward**. Inner layers never import from outer layers.

```
core  ◄──  application  ◄──  presentation
  ▲             ▲
  └──── infra ──┘
```

| Layer | Folder | Responsibility | May depend on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Core** | `core/` | Domain models, types, constants. Pure data, zero dependencies. | — |
| **Application** | `application/` | Use cases: date math (`Jalali`, `DateConverter`) and the content-script pipeline (`content/`). | core |
| **Infrastructure** | `infra/` | Adapters to the outside world: `storage` (chrome.storage), `i18n`, `messaging`, `translation`. | core |
| **Presentation** | `presentation/` | UI: popup, options, datepicker, reload banner, and styles. | core, application, infra |

## Build

The project is built with **Vite** (fix #7). Because MV3 content scripts must be
plain IIFEs (no ESM at runtime), `scripts/vite-build.mjs` drives Vite's library
mode once per entry (`content`, `popup`, `options`) and emits a flat `dist/`.

```bash
npm install         # install dev dependencies (vite, sass, vitest, esbuild, …)
npm run build       # Vite build → dist/   (primary)
npm run build:check # tsc --noEmit THEN build
npm run build:esbuild # esbuild + sass fallback build → dist/
npm run dev         # esbuild watch (fast incremental rebuilds)
```

> SCSS is imported directly from each entry (`import "./popup.scss"`), so Vite
> compiles and emits `popup.css` / `options.css` / `content.css` automatically.
> The esbuild fallback resolves those `.scss` imports to an empty module and
> compiles the stylesheets separately with `sass`.

The build produces a **flat `dist/` folder** that Edge/Chrome can load directly:

```
dist/
├── manifest.json
├── content.js      # bundled application/content/index.ts
├── content.css     # compiled presentation/content.scss
├── popup.html
├── popup.js        # bundled presentation/components/popup/popup.ts
├── popup.css
├── options.html
├── options.js      # bundled presentation/components/options/options.ts
├── options.css
└── icons/
```

- **TypeScript** is bundled into self-contained IIFE files (no ES imports remain
  at runtime, which is required for MV3 content scripts).
- **SCSS** is compiled by Vite (or `sass` in the fallback build).
- `.html` component templates are imported as raw text and inlined at build time
  (used by the ReloadBanner and the datepicker — fix #4) via a small Vite plugin
  in `vite.config.ts`.

---

## Testing

Unit tests use **Vitest** with the **jsdom** environment (fix #9). A chrome.*
mock and DOM reset live in `tests/setup.ts`.

```bash
npm test           # run the suite once
npm run test:watch # watch mode
npm run coverage   # V8 coverage report → ./coverage
```

Covered areas: Jalali date math, the date converter & field detection, i18n,
the settings repository (chrome.storage), the Persian datepicker, and the reload
banner. See [`tests/README.md`](./tests/README.md).

### Load the extension

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Open `edge://extensions` or `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` folder.

## Features

- Gregorian → Persian (Jalali) date conversion across text, inputs, grids, and
  calendar views on supported Microsoft sites.
- Optional Persian digits and Persian month names.
- Optional embedded Persian datepicker that replaces native pickers.
- Tooltips showing the original value, and safe restore-on-save so the host app
  still receives Gregorian values.
- Popup quick-toggle + full options page with live preview.
- English/Persian interface language with RTL support.
- Mock dictionary manager (scaffolding for a future translation feature).

## Why vanilla TypeScript (not React)?

The heaviest part of this extension is the **content script**, which mutates the
host page's existing DOM (Dynamics/SharePoint/etc.). A virtual-DOM framework like
React adds no value there — and actually fights you — because you are editing
third-party nodes you don't own. So the content pipeline stays as small, testable
vanilla TS modules.

The **popup** and **options** pages are small, form-driven surfaces; plain TS with
the i18n helper keeps the bundle tiny and dependency-free. If these pages grow
significantly, they are isolated enough that they could be migrated to React (or
Preact, which is lighter for extensions) without touching `core`, `application`,
or `infra`.
